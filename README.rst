NOTICE: I am going to be moving/renaming/discontinuing/refactoring hitagiFS to
dantalian: https://github.com/darkfeline/dantalian

RATIONALE: hitagiFS is still in (early) development, even though it's done at
its core.  The original name stood for HIerarchical TAG File System, and in my
initial design sketches, I meant to use FUSE as a core feature, hence "file
system".  However, now that's pretty irrelevant.  Also, "file system" is
starting to become confusing terminology applied to this metaphor.

In addition, I plan on addition MUCH more supporting features to
hitagiFS/dantalian for media organization.  At its core, it WILL remain a
simply transparent tag-based organization paradigm as it is now, but I would
like to add more (entirely optional) features to assist in media organization,
such as tag parsing, duplicate detection, etc.

Hence the new planned name dantalian, named after the 71th Duke of Hell, listed
in Ars Goetia.  He teaches all arts and sciences, and knows the thoughts of all
people.
